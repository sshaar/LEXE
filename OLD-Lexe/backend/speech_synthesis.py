    para = "The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953. [note 3] The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science. Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, statistics, and logic. [57] In 1981, the BBC produced a micro-computer and classroom network and Computer Studies became common for GCE O level students (11â€“16-year-old), and Computer Science to A level students. [11] As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general."
